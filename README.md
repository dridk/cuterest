## What is CuteRest
CuteRest is an open source tool dedicated to communicate with a REST server. It's particulary useful to manage 
JSON request during developement phase. Actually, there are several tools for this purpose. You can use plugins for
your browser, like [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm) or use [httpie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie) as command-line from your console. But those applications do not provide
a tree view of the JSON or XML response. You only have raw data, and you must use another software, like 
[jsonviewer](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/) to view your content as a tree.  
CuteRest does have both. It's a REST client which have different view to parse the response.

## Linux
CuteRest works well on Linux. There aren't packages avaible for any distribution yet. I will publish a Debian package
as soon as possible. For now, you'll need to compile it as described below. 

## From source
Compiling on Windows, OSX, Linux, and FreeBSD is really easy. But CuteRest needs at least Qt5.4. Older version will generate complaints during the compilation. 
* Download the community Qt 5.4 SDK from [qt.io](http://www.qt.io/download/).
* Download the source code from `master` branch. 
* From Qt Creator, File > Open project, then select `cuterest.pro`.
* Compile and run it by clicking on the green button.

If you want to install it on your system, compile and install it from the command line by using `qmake` in your Qt installation path. 
    
    qmake cuterest.pro
    make
    sudo make install
